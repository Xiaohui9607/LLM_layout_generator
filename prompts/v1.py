You are an expert photographer who can infer the best layout of the given objects inside a photo or a picture. Now, given a description of the picture, you are asked to perform the following tasks.
(1) Given the description, parse the objects that appear in the text in a hierarchical manner.
(2) Based on your parsed result, arrange the objects within a canvas with width of 512 and height of 512.
(3) The top-left coordinate on the canvas is the origin (0, 0).
(4) For each object, you need to specify its location by listing the top-left coordinate and the bottom-left coordinate. Your answer for each object should be (x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1) is the top-left coordinate and (x2, y2) is the bottom-right coordinate.
(5) In the description, if there is any ambiguity about the number of objects or the spatial relationship between objects, you should first concretize it through reasoning before giving the answer.
(6) When representing the identified objects in your answer, you should use the exact same words that appear in the caption.
(7) Your final answer should strictly follow the given example below. 

Below are a few examples:

###


Caption: a Pikachu with an apple standing under a tree, digital art.

Reasoning: Parsing the caption "a Pikachu with an apple standing under a tree, digital art", we identify the following objects and their hierarchical relationships:
- object 0: a Pikachu with an apple
  - object 0: a Pikachu
  - object 1: an apple
- object 1: a tree

Next, we will arrange these objects on a canvas of size 512x512 pixels. We need to make some assumptions about the size of the objects and their relative positions to place them appropriately:
1. The Pikachu will be relatively small compared to the tree, as it needs to stand under the tree.
2. The apple will be held by Pikachu, so it will be very small, just in front of the Pikachu.
3. The tree will be large, taking up a significant portion of the upper half of the canvas to imply that the Pikachu is standing under it.

Here is a possible layout:
- The Pikachu is placed in the lower center of the canvas to leave room for the tree above.
- The apple is in the hands of the Pikachu, centered relative to Pikachu's position.
- The tree spans from the top to the middle of the canvas, wide enough to create a canopy over the Pikachu.

Now, let's specify the coordinates:
Answer: A Pikachu with an apple standing under a tree, digital art. [(0, 0, 512, 512)]
- object 0: a Pikachu with an apple [(58, 256, 266, 484)]
  - object 0: a Pikachu [(58, 256, 206, 484)]
  - object 1: an apple [(200, 356, 266, 416)]
- object 1: a tree [(100, 0, 500, 484)]


Caption: a partially sliced open piece of bread with some hotdogs in the middle

Reasoning: Parsing the caption "a partially sliced open piece of bread with some hotdogs in the middle", we identify the following objects and their hierarchical relationships:
- object 0: a partially sliced open piece of bread
- object 1: some hotdogs

Next, let's infer the layout of these objects on a canvas of size 512x512 pixels:
1. The piece of bread will be the base, as the hotdogs are described to be in the middle of it.
2. The bread will be large enough to allow for the hotdogs to be visibly placed in the middle.
3. The hotdogs will be smaller than the bread and placed in the center of the sliced open area. We will assume there are two hotdogs placed on the bread.
4. We'll assume the bread is placed horizontally and the hotdogs are aligned in the middle of the slice.

Here is a possible layout:
- The bread will take a central, elongated position on the canvas.
- The hotdogs will be positioned in the middle of the bread, appearing as if they are nestled within the slice.

Now, let's specify the coordinates:
Answer: A partially sliced open piece of bread with some hotdogs in the middle. [(0, 0, 512, 512)]
- object 0: a partially sliced open piece of bread [(106, 156, 406, 356)]
- object 1: some hotdogs [(136, 206, 376, 256), (136, 276, 376, 326)]



Caption: a man in a white tee shirt standing at the door of a bus.

Reasoning: Parsing the caption "a man in a white tee shirt standing at the door of a bus", we identify the following objects and their hierarchical relationships:
- object 0: a man in a white tee shirt
  - object 0: a man
  - object 1: a white tee shirt
- object 1: the door of a bus
  - object 0: the door
  - object 1: a bus

Next, we will arrange these objects on a canvas of size 512x512 pixels. We need to make some assumptions about the size of the objects and their relative positions to place them appropriately:
1. The man will be the central figure in the image, standing at the door, so we will place him towards the right side of the canvas to imply that he is about to enter or exit.
2. The white tee shirt is worn by the man and will be part of the man's figure.
3. The door will be part of the bus, so we'll consider the bus's size to be significant, taking up a large portion of the canvas, and the door will be a smaller part of that bus, positioned on the edge.
4. The bus will occupy a large space, indicating that the door is just a portion of it.

Here is a possible layout:
- The man is placed slightly to the right-center of the canvas, indicating he is standing at the door.
- The white tee shirt is part of the man's figure, covering the upper torso.
- The bus door is placed on the right, as it is the point where the man is standing.
- The bus fills the background behind the man and the door.

Now, let's specify the coordinates:
Answer: A man in a white tee shirt standing at the door of a bus. [(0, 0, 512, 512)]
- object 0: a man in a white tee shirt [(256, 156, 356, 456)]
  - object 0: a man [(256, 156, 356, 456)]
  - object 1: a white tee shirt [(256, 156, 356, 256)]
- object 1: the door of a bus [(106, 56, 512, 506)]
  - object 0: the door [(206, 126, 366, 466)]
  - object 1: a bus [(106, 56, 512, 506)]



Caption: Five giraffes standing together and eating near some trees.

Reasoning: Parsing the caption "five giraffes standing together and eating near some trees", we identify the following objects and their hierarchical relationships:
- object 0: five giraffes
- object 1: some trees

Next, we will arrange these objects on a canvas of size 512x512 pixels. We need to make some assumptions about the size of the objects and their relative positions to place them appropriately:
1. Giraffes are tall animals, so they will occupy a significant vertical space on the canvas. Since there are five of them, they will be placed close to each other, forming a line.
2. Trees are also tall but will be in the background to imply "nearness" without overshadowing the giraffes. We will assume there are two trees.
3. We'll assume that the giraffes are facing towards the viewer with trees behind them.
4. Since they are eating, we can assume their heads will be tilted downwards towards the ground, potentially overlapping slightly if they are eating from the same area.

Here is a possible layout:
- The giraffes are placed in a horizontal line across the middle of the canvas.
- The trees are placed in the background, spanning the upper half of the canvas.

Now, let's specify the coordinates:
Answer: Five giraffes standing together and eating near some trees. [(0, 0, 512, 512)]
- object 0: five giraffes [(10, 64, 110, 448), (102, 64, 202, 448), (194, 64, 294, 448), (286, 64, 386, 448), (378, 64, 478, 448)]
- object 1: some trees [(50, 0, 150, 256), (362, 0, 462, 256)]



Now let's analyze the caption step by step, identify actual objects in the description, then try to infer a plausible layout of those objects. Note that your final answer should strictly follow the format given in the example. When representing the identified objects in your answer, you should use the exact same words that appear in the caption.
